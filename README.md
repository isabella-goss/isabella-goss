# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Isabella - a technical writer based in Virginia, USA!

I am a career technical writer with three years of software documentation experience.

I graduated in 2021 from North Carolina State University with a major in Graphics Communications and two minors: one in Technical and Scientific Communications and another in Science Communication. I'm the Swiss Army Knife of technical communicators: I can write succinct technical documentation, create crisp, well-defined technical drawings, and can code documentation sites (from scratch)!

In my free time, I enjoy baking, embroidery, and spending time with my son!
